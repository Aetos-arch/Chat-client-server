# Distributed Network Chat Application

This project is a distributed network chat application consisting of a Java server and a C client. The software enables users to communicate with each other through chat messages, and the server is capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously.

# Features
- Client-Server Architecture: The application follows a client-server model, where multiple clients can connect to the server and exchange messages.
- Chat Messaging: Users can send and receive chat messages in real-time through the server.
- Concurrent Connections: The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently, allowing multiple users to participate in the chat simultaneously.
- Synchronized Communication: The client-server communication is synchronized to ensure proper message delivery and ordering.

# Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the server machine.
- C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on the client machine.
